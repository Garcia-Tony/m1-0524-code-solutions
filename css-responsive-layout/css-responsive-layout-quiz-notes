## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
A breakpoint in responsive web design is a specific point (or range) at which the layout of a website changes to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
Percentage widths allows the layout to adjust automatically to the size of the parent container.
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
The order of the CSS rules in the stylesheet determines which one takes control by which one is lastly added.
