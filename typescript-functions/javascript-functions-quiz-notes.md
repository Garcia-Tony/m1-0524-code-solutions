## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is a collection of code which performs a specific task.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  Function definition has 6 parts, the function keyword, an optional name, zero or more parameters, a code block and an optional return statement, the end of the code block
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  functions calls have 2 parts , the function name and a comma separated list of zero or more arguments surrounded by a parentheses ()
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  function definition defines the code, while function call executes the code inside the function.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  When we define a function we declare parameters and when we call a function, we pass it arguments.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Because they are used as a placeholder. It is basically a variable whose value is not known until we call the function and pass an argument.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  1.Causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program.
  2.Prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  const variable = () => {
  return ;
  };
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  There are no return statements, there are no {} to indicate a code block, the code block consists of only one line of code. The implicit return functionality of an arrow function only works when those conditions are met.
